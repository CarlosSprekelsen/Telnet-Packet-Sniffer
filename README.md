# High-Performance C/C++ Telnet & Packet Sniffing Program

## Project Overview

This project implements a high-speed C/C++ application optimized for Linux. The primary functionality involves using Telnet to execute specified commands and `libpcap` to sniff and analyze network packets. This program aims to deliver exceptional performance and real-time responsiveness tailored to demanding use cases, including network diagnostics and command-based automation.

## Features

- **Telnet Command Execution**: Communicates and executes commands over Telnet sessions.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Uses `libpcap` to capture and process network packets for analysis and monitoring.
- **High Performance and Low Latency**: Designed for efficient execution with minimal resource overhead.
- **Modular and Maintainable Codebase**: Leverages clear separation of concerns and C++ best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before building and running the project, ensure the following dependencies and prerequisites are met:

- **Operating System**: Linux-based system
- **Build System**: CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- **Compiler**: GCC or Clang
- **Libraries**: `libpcap` (must be pre-installed)

## Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build and run the application:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Compile the program:
   ```
   make
   ```

## Usage Instructions

Upon building, the application can be executed as follows (assuming it generates an executable named `telnet_sniffer`):

```
./telnet_sniffer <arguments>
```

**Note**: Replace `<arguments>` with the specific options or parameters for your desired use case.

## Detailed Component Overview

### TelnetClient Class
- **Purpose**: Manages Telnet connections, handles command transmission, and processes responses.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `connect()`: Establishes a Telnet connection.
  - `sendCommand(const std::string& command)`: Sends a command over the established connection.
  - `receiveResponse()`: Receives and returns the response from the Telnet session.
  - `closeConnection()`: Terminates the connection gracefully.

### PacketSniffer Class
- **Purpose**: Leverages `libpcap` to capture, filter, and process network packets.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `initialize(const std::string& device, const std::string& filter)`: Sets up the packet sniffer on the specified network device with a given filter.
  - `startSniffing()`: Begins capturing packets.
  - `processPacket()`: Processes a captured packet (callback mechanism).
  - `stopSniffing()`: Stops packet capture and cleans up resources.

### CommandHandler Class
- **Purpose**: Serves as the main coordinator between `TelnetClient` and `PacketSniffer` for executing commands and monitoring network responses.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `executeCommand(const std::string& command)`: Executes a Telnet command and monitors the response.
  - `monitorResponse()`: Handles and analyzes network data relevant to the issued command.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvements include:

- **Security Improvements**: Enhancing security mechanisms for Telnet communications (e.g., encrypted connections).
- **Advanced Packet Filtering**: Adding more robust and customizable packet filtering capabilities.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Fine-tuning for even greater efficiency and reduced resource usage.
